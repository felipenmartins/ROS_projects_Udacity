# Project 2. Go Chase It!
Use ROS, C++, and Gazebo to build and program a ball-chasing robot. It consists of designing a robot inside Gazebo, house it in a world you have to build, 
and code a C++ node in ROS to chase a white ball.

## Requirements
To run the code from this repository you will need to use [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic).
